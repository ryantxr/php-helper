# php-helper

Array and String Helpers.

These are the array functions from Laravel packaged to be used independently of
any framework. These functions are namespaced and created as static functions
of a class.

This is not yet in Packagist and I'm not sure I will put it there.

You can install with Composer from the repo. Add the following to composer.json.

```json
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url":  "git@github.com:ryantxr/php-helper.git"
        }
    ],
    "require":{
        "ryantxr/helper": "dev-master"
    }
```

Versions will be added later. Use dev-master for now.
